# __BACKGROUND IS A WORK IN PROGRESS__

*Jaleon* hails from __Wayrest__, where he was born into a poor family who owned a bakery. He mostly 
serviced customers at the counter but was eventually banned by his father for repeatedly adding
unorthodox ingredients that would enhance flavors but had unwarranted (hallucinogenic or magical)
side effects to improve his sales.

He then joined up with a gang of __con artists__, several of whom had some form of __alchemy training__, 
selling self-proclaimed ailments, stimulants, snake oil ingredients, etc. He learned under the two
most accomplished alchemists of the tricksters, who both had formal training themselves.

Eventually he was forced to leave Wayrest after developing a reputation bigger than list of so-called
cures and salves, leaving him with little marks left to swindle. Having heard about the recent __Blight__
in __Tvvardenfell__, he saw an opporunity to help relieve its citizens of their troubles (coinpurses). 

Unlike most con artists, or generally salespeople, *Jaleon* is not known for his charisma, but more
because of his ability to observe and determine what potential buyers may need or depend on and suiting
his "inventory" for the customer.
